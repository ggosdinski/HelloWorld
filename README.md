# Overview

This project is a simple "Hello World" application created to begin my personal software portfolio and solidify my understanding of using GitHub for version control. As a software engineer, I aim to document and share all the code I build to demonstrate my progress and proficiency in new technologies.

This software prints a personalized greeting message to the screen. It's a starting point to establish good habits in documentation, version control, and clear communication of technical work.
